# Agriculture-Crop-Recommendations-Using-Productivity-and-Season.
This project aims to develop a predictive model that can recommend optimal crop choices for farmers based on historical productivity data and seasonal factors. By analyzing various data points, the model will provide farmers with valuable insights to maximize crop yields and minimize risks.
